I wanted to take this time to say "hello"... and "thank you" for being one of our CHARTER advertisers on {{ site.domain }}!!!

We have been seeing significant increases in our business since we launched this site. The number of folks receiving your coupons continues to rise on a daily basis... thanks to heavy and ongoing broadcast advertising! Across the board, we are currently in 77 markets in the United States; and our database of consumers is growing rapidly. 

As you know, the easiest and cheapest way to grow a successful business is by word of mouth. That said, please pass the word around to people that you think might benefit from getting great local coupons...

We will touch base every once in a while to share with you what we have going on since we are in the very early stages of growth and change! We need your input! Please let us know your thoughts/comments/complaints!!!!  Testimonials are always welcome and we can share them with everyone so please, don't be shy... tell us about your successes using {{ site.domain }}!!!

Just a little insight for you...

Our sites are never complete and our team is continually working to build and grow the sites.
