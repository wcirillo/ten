Letter from the CEO:

Dear Media Partner,

You may have noticed that your quarterly checks are TINY! 
(Yes, we've noticed too... and we are NOT happy! )

So... hold on to the edge of your seat... because we are swingin' for the FENCES!!!

By the end of 2012, we plan to have AT LEAST 7,000 Independent Reps around the US...
helping small businesses post coupons...
and getting  their friends to receive our free weekly email flyers!!!

Does this sound like a Direct Selling company?

Well, it should... because THAT is what we are launching September 1!!!

Like Avon, Mary Kay, Tupperware, Keller Williams Real Estate, Aflac and thousands of other successful Direct Selling companies, we plan to show explosive growth thanks to a huge army of independent reps.

The reps will be paid for 3 things:
1) Selling local business on posting coupons on the local 10LocalCoupons site,
2) Convincing their friends to opt in to receive the weekly email flyer and
3) Referring others to become independent reps for {{ site.domain }}!

It is our view... that this extraordinary combination (a huge army of independent reps... combined with the extraordinary brand recognition provided by our media partners AND the first class technology we are building) will allow us to grow FAST and will give us an exciting and defensible business model that will be VERY unique and HIGHLY profitable for our media partners!

We are SO excited at the possibilities of this new business model...
And we can't WAIT to start sending you large quarterly checks.
Frankly, I'm sorry we didn't figure this out a year ago.
We thank you for your patience.
Now HOLD ON for an exciting (and we hope - VERY PROFITABLE) Ride!!!!

Best,

Eric Straus
